The Cramér's V value of 0.3519 suggests a moderate correlation between occupation and income, while the Statistical Parity analysis resulted in a maximum Z-value of 0.5688, indicating a moderate level of disparity in income distribution across different occupations.

This means there is a noticeable association between the type of occupation and the income level, but it is not extremely strong. This level of correlation suggests that while occupation does influence income, other factors may also play significant roles.\n\n- **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The maximum Z-value of 0.5688 also indicates a moderate level of bias. This suggests that there are some differences in income distribution among different occupations, but these differences are not extreme. It is important to consider these disparities when analyzing the dataset, as they may impact the conclusions drawn from the data.\n\n### Overall Bias Level\n\nBased on the results from both the Cramér's V and Statistical Parity analyses, the overall bias level can be categorized as moderate. This means that while there is some bias present in the relationship between occupation and income, it does not fully compromise the dataset's usability. However, it is advisable to consider this bias in certain applications.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nI will generate a detailed detection report summarizing these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the relationship between occupation and income in the dataset 'source_files/Adult.csv' indicates a moderate level of bias.
