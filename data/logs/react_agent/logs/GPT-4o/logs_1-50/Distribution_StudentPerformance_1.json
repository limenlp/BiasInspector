    "output": "The bias detection report for the \"Student Performance\" dataset has been successfully generated. The analysis focused on the \"address\" feature, which represents the place of residence (urban or rural) of the students. Here is a detailed summary of the findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type**: Distribution\n2. **Relevant Feature(s)**: \"address\" (place of residence)\n3. **Bias Level**: Moderate Bias\n   - **Shannon Balance**: 0.765, indicating moderate diversity.\n   - **Max-Min Ratio**: 3.49, suggesting a significant difference between categories.\n   - **Entropy**: 0.765, showing moderate uncertainty.\n   - **Gini Index**: 0.347 (Corrected), 0.694 (Adjusted), indicating moderate inequality.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n- The analysis indicates a moderate level of bias in the distribution of the \"address\" feature. The results suggest that while there is some bias, it does not fully compromise the dataset's usability. However, it is advisable to consider this bias in certain applications. The moderate bias level is supported by the Shannon Balance, Entropy, and Gini Index, which all point to a moderate level of diversity, uncertainty, and inequality in the distribution. The Max-Min Ratio highlights a significant difference between categories, suggesting a potential dominance of one category.\n\nThe bar chart visualization of the distribution has been included in the report to provide a clear representation of the data. You can download the detailed bias detection report from the following link: [Bias Detection Report](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nIf you have any additional needs or other tasks to be done, please let me know!",
