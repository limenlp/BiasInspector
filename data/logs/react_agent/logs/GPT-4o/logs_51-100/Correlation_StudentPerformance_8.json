According to the bias level categorization for Statistical Parity, this falls into Level 1, representing no significant bias.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n\n1. **Bias Type:** Correlation\n2. **Relevant Features:** 'activities' (student activities) and 'Fjob' (father's occupation)\n3. **Bias Level:**\n   - **Cramér's V:** Level 1 (No significant bias)\n   - **Statistical Parity:** Level 1 (No significant bias)\n4. **Overall Bias Level:** Level 1 (No significant bias)\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n- **Cramér's V Analysis:** The Cramér's V value of 0.074 indicates a very weak association between student activities and father's occupation. This suggests that there is no significant correlation between these two features, and the distribution of student activities is not strongly influenced by the father's occupation.\n\n- **Statistical Parity Analysis:** The maximum Z-value of 0.0747 further supports the finding that there is no significant disparity in the distribution of student activities across different father's occupations. This means that the likelihood of a student participating in activities is fairly consistent regardless of their father's job type.\n\nOverall, the analysis indicates that there is no significant bias or correlation between student activities and father's occupation in the dataset. The findings suggest that student participation in activities is not influenced by the father's occupation, and the distribution is balanced across different job types.\n\nI will now generate a detailed detection report based on these findings.\n\nAction: generate_bias_report_pdf\nAction Input: {\"tool_input\": \"The analysis of the dataset 'Student Performance.csv' focused on detecting bias in the correlation between student activities and father's occupation.
