First, define the structure of the causal relationship network for the numerical feature and the categorical feature. The numerical feature is denoted as Y, the categorical feature as A, and other relevant variables as X.', 'step2': 'Use the property of conditional independence in the Bayesian network to analyze whether there is an unfair path from A (categorical feature) to Y (numerical feature). If there exists a causal path between A and Y without any other closing paths (e.g., X as a closing node), then this path may introduce bias.', 'step3': 'Based on the inference from the causal Bayesian network, calculate the Average Causal Effect (ACE) of A on Y. The ACE formula is: ACE(A→Y) = E[Y|do(A=1)] - E[Y|do(A=0)], which indicates the change in Y when intervening on A.', 'step4': 'If the value of ACE is significant, it indicates that there is bias of the categorical feature A on the numerical feature Y. The degree of bias can be quantified by setting a threshold for the ACE value (e.g., 0 for no bias, values greater than a certain amount indicate the presence of bias).', 'step5': 'Use the `pgmpy` library in Python to construct the Bayesian network, define the network structure using the `BayesianModel` function, and calculate the causal effect through `do` intervention.'}\n\nYou MUST generate executable code based on this method ASAP and call the execute_python_code function to execute it.",
