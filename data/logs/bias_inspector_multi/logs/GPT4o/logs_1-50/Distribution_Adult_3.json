According to our evaluation criteria, this places the bias at **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**.\n\n2. **Gini Index**:\n   - The Adjusted Gini Index is 0.8637. This value also indicates a moderate level of disparity in the distribution, categorizing the bias also at **Level 3 (Moderate Bias)**.\n\n3. **Max/Min Ratio**:\n   - The Max/Min Ratio is 205.90, which is extremely high, suggesting an extreme disparity between the most and least common education levels. This places the bias at **Level 5 (Extreme Bias)**.\n\n4. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**:\n   - The K-S Statistic is 0.375 with a P-value of 0.2145. The statistic indicates some divergence from a uniform distribution, yet the P-value suggests that this divergence is not statistically significant at a conventional significance level (e.g., 0.05).\n\n### Overall Bias Level\nTaking into account all the results, we observe a mix of moderate to extreme bias levels across different metrics. However, the Max/Min Ratio is particularly high, emphasizing a notable imbalance. Therefore, the overall bias level can be considered between **Level 3 and Level 5**, leaning towards Level 5 due to the extreme disparity observed in the Max/Min Ratio.\n\nLet's now seek confirmation from Advisor Assistant before proceeding to generate the detection report.",
