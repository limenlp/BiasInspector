Here's what I can help you with:\n\n1. **Bias Detection Task Definition:** We can work together to define a clear detection task based on your dataset. You can specify whether you're interested in analyzing correlations or distributions.\n\n2. **Overall Plan Formulation:** I'll create a comprehensive plan for executing the bias detection task, selecting methods from both available tools and relevant literature.\n\n3. **Tool Execution:** I'll use the appropriate tools to execute the task, including writing code if necessary.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:** Once the analysis is complete, I'll provide a detailed summary of the findings, including bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.\n\n5. **Iterative Communication:** Throughout the process, I'll engage in discussions with an Advisor Assistant to ensure the plan's completeness and to make necessary adjustments.\n\nIf you have a dataset and a specific bias detection task in mind, please let me know, and we can get started! If not, feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

This suggests that there is a dominant pattern in the distribution of urban and rural addresses among students.\n\n### Overall Bias Level Assessment:\nBased on the analyses conducted using both the toolset and the Chi-Square test from the reference literature, the `address` feature shows a moderate level of bias (Level 3) in its distribution. The results from various analyses including Shannon Entropy, Max/Min Ratio, Gini Index, and Relative Risk consistently indicate a moderate bias, which aligns with the significant finding from the Chi-Square test.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Visualization**: Create visualizations to further illustrate the distribution of the `address` feature.\n2. **Comprehensive Summary**: Prepare a detailed summary of the findings, including bias type, relevant features, bias level, and additional explanations.\n\nI will proceed with creating visualizations and summarizing the findings. Shall we go ahead with the visualization part?",
