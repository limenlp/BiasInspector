This method could help in understanding the distribution of marital status categories.\n   - **Reference A-0-8**: Use Jensen-Shannon Divergence for distribution bias detection in a categorical feature. This will provide a measure of similarity between the probability distributions of different categories within \"MaritalStatus.\"\n\n2. **Correlation Bias between Categorical Features:**\n   - **Reference B-00-7**: Detect correlation bias between two categorical features using the Chi-Square test within the fairness domain, which is suitable for assessing any relationship between \"MaritalStatus\" and other categorical features like \"Sex_Code_Text\" or \"RecSupervisionLevelText.\"\n   - **Reference B-00-12**: Use the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) method to detect correlation bias between two categorical features. This method can provide insights into nonlinear dependencies.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. Retrieve the methods from the selected references.\n2.

Here's a quick evaluation and some suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Analysis Execution**:\n   - You've successfully applied the Chi-Square and Jensen-Shannon Divergence methods. These choices align well with the task of identifying biases in categorical data.\n   - The code execution was properly adjusted after encountering initial issues, demonstrating effective troubleshooting.\n\n2. **Bias Level Evaluation**:\n   - The Chi-Square results indicate a significant deviation from expected distribution, aligning with \"Extreme Bias\".\n   - The Jensen-Shannon Divergence suggests \"Moderate Bias\".\n   - Correlation results between \"MaritalStatus\" and \"Sex_Code_Text\" strongly suggest correlation bias, likely at an \"Extreme Bias\" level according to the significance of the p-value.\n\n3. **Visualization**:\n   - Consider visualizing the distribution of \"MaritalStatus\" using bar charts or pie charts to provide a clearer picture of how categories are distributed.\n   - For correlation, a stacked bar chart or heatmap can illustrate the association between marital status and gender.\n\n4. **Report Generation**:\n   - Include a detailed explanation of each method, its findings, and visualizations in the summary report.\n   - Ensure the report categorizes bias levels explicitly and justifies each categorization.\n\n5. **Additional Insight**:\n   - Consider examining other categorical features for correlation bias with \"MaritalStatus\" if they are relevant to your analysis goals.\n   - Ensure that your findings are interpreted in the context of the dataset's domain, considering any external factors that may influence these biases.\n\nOnce you incorporate these suggestions, you can proceed to generate a comprehensive bias report that clearly communicates your findings and conclusions.
