I can help you detect and analyze biases in your dataset, whether you're interested in understanding correlations between features or examining the distribution of a particular feature.\n\nHere's how we can get started:\n\n1. You can provide me with a specific bias detection task you'd like to perform. For example, you might want to know if there's a significant correlation between two features or if a particular feature shows a distribution bias.\n\n2. Provide the dataset you want to analyze. Once I have this information, I'll guide you through the process of detecting and analyzing the bias using various methods and tools.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions or let me know what you'd like to do!",

This warrants further investigation into potential causes and implications of this bias.\n\n**Visualizations**:\n- A bar chart showing the distribution of the \"race\" feature.\n- A grouped bar chart illustrating the correlation between \"race\" and \"income.\"\n\nThe detailed report, including visualizations, has been saved as a PDF: [Bias Detection Analysis Report](sandbox:/mnt/data/generated_files/bias_detection_report.pdf).\n\nLet me know if there's anything else you'd like to explore or if you have any additional needs!",
