Statistical analysis to compare the distribution of 'income' across different 'native-country' categories.\n\nTo execute these methods, I will:\n1. Use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to obtain the method for reference B-01-10.\n2. Generate executable code based on this method and call the execute_python_code function to execute it.\n3. Use the load_csv_file tool to load the dataset and extract the relevant features.\n4. Use the categorical_categorical_correlation_cramers_v tool to calculate the correlation between 'native-country' and 'income'.\n5. Use the categorical_distribution_shannon_balance tool to analyze the distribution of 'income' across different 'native-country' categories.\n\nNext, I will use the get_user_input_tool to ask the user if they want to proceed with the analysis.",
