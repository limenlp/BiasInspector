Since the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that the two categorical variables are independent. This suggests that there is a correlation bias between the 'romantic' and 'sex' features in the dataset.\nTo further analyze the correlation bias, we can use other methods such as calculating the Cramér's V or the odds ratio. We can also visualize the relationship between the two variables using a heatmap or a bar chart.\nNext, we will use the get_reference_method_by_id tool to retrieve another method for detecting correlation bias between two categorical features.
