Additionally, I can utilize the `categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool to calculate Cohen's d and evaluate the effect size of the relationship.\n\nTo further inform my approach, I will retrieve relevant reference literature using the `get_all_reference_intentions` tool and select methods from references with ending digits greater than 5.\n\nNext, I will use the `get_reference_method_by_id` tool to retrieve specific methods from the selected references and incorporate them into my analysis plan.\n\nAfter finalizing my plan, I will execute the selected tools and methods, generate visualizations, and provide a detailed summary of my findings.\n\nPlease wait while I proceed with the analysis.",
