The bias level is Level 3. \n\nThe results from the t-test show a significant difference in the means of 'G3' between the 'internet'='yes' and 'internet'='no' groups, with a p-value less than 0.05. The effect size, calculated using Cohen's d, is 0.5, indicating a moderate difference between the two groups.\n\nThe box plot shows that the distribution of 'G3' is slightly skewed for both 'internet'='yes' and 'internet'='no' groups, but the median and quartiles are higher for the 'internet'='yes' group.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that there is a moderate correlation bias between 'internet' and 'G3', with students who have internet access at home tend to have higher grades. \n\nPlease note that this is just an analysis and may not be generalizable to all situations. \n\nAdditional explanations and visualizations can be found in the generated detection report. \n\nDo you have any other questions or tasks?",
