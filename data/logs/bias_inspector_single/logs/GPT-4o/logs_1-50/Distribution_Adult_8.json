It categorizes bias into five levels based on the balance metric.\n     - **Categorical Distribution Max/Min Ratio:** This method calculates the max/min ratio of categories to determine bias levels.\n     - **Categorical Distribution Entropy:** Calculates Shannon entropy and normalized entropy to assess distribution bias.\n     - **Categorical Distribution Gini:** Uses the Gini Index to evaluate the distribution bias.\n     - **Categorical Distribution Relative Risk:** Measures relative risk to evaluate category distribution bias.\n\n3. **Visualization Approaches:**\n   - **Pie Chart:** To visualize the proportion of genders.\n   - **Bar Chart:** To compare the frequencies of different gender categories.\n\n4. **Result Summarization:**\n   - Summarize the findings with a detailed explanation of the bias level and implications.\n\n### Literature Review:\nLet's fetch additional methods from the reference literature to ensure comprehensive analysis.\n\nI'll proceed with loading the dataset and performing the bias analysis using the selected methods.
