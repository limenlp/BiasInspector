This suggests that the distribution is neither fully uniform nor extremely biased.\n- **Z-Score Analysis**: The significant Z-Score for the category \"existing credits paid back duly till now\" suggests that this category is overrepresented in comparison to others.\n\nOverall, these findings indicate that there may be inherent biases in the historical credit opportunities available to individuals, particularly favoring those with existing credits paid back duly. This could suggest systemic biases in prior credit opportunities.\n\nI'll now generate a detailed bias detection report based on this analysis.",
