It's suitable for analyzing the difference in assessment scores between different genders. Therefore, I'll use the `functions.categorical_numerical_correlation_cohens_d` tool.\n   - **Standardized Difference**: This method evaluates the difference in means relative to variability and is useful for analyzing bias between a categorical and a numerical feature. I'll use the `functions.categorical_numerical_correlation_standardized_difference` tool.\n\n2. **From Reference Literature**:\n   - **B-01-10**: This intention involves detecting correlation bias between a categorical and a numerical feature using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). This method is appropriate for measuring dependence between the gender and assessment scores. I'll retrieve the method using this reference ID.\n\n#### Step 3: Visualization\n- **Box Plot**: To visually assess the distribution of assessment scores across different genders, I'll use a box plot.\n\nLet's begin by extracting the necessary columns and cleaning any missing values if needed. Then, we'll execute the selected methods.",
